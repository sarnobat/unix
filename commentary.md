### Goals

To educate rookie command line users (mostly on Mac) to the range of things the command line can do, without intimidation.

The emphasis is more on breadth of features rather than depth.

Some commands are Mac-specific. The majority should work on other *nix systems (GNU Linux, BSD, Cygwin).
