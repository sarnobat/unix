### Goals

To educate and encourage rookie command line users (mostly on Mac) to the range of things the command line can do, without intimidation. No need to memorize these commands.

The emphasis is more on breadth of features rather than depth.

Some commands are Mac-specific. The majority should work on other *nix systems (GNU Linux, BSD, Cygwin).

### Why use the command line

* Takes less memory, runs faster
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Remotely control your computer
* Understand operating systems conceptually
